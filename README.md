# Apart-List

Making apartment hunting a bit easier.

Apart-List is a website that scraps through [apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/) based on the link you provide and turns the information into an Excel file. The link has to be an apartment link, with no house, no condos, and no townhomes. 

Example link: 

&check; https://www.apartments.com/apartments/houston-tx/

&cross; https://www.apartments.com/apartments-houses-condos/los-angeles-ca/

&cross; https://www.apartments.com/condos/new-york-ny/

(You'll need to put the full link of the page)

Right now the website only works for apartments.com, but I plan on adding other apartment listing websites to be available. I'm also planning to add houses, condos, and townhomes available also.
