# Project Discontinued

## Important Update:
The Apart-List project has been discontinued due to a legal request from Apartments.com. They requested that I stop using their content, as it violated their terms of use. To comply with their request and avoid potential legal action, I have taken the project offline and ceased further development.

I appreciate the support and interest from everyone who explored this project. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about the technical aspects of the project, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding!
# Apart-List

Making apartment hunting a bit easier.

Apart-List is a website that scraps through [apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/) based on the link you provide and turns the information into an Excel file. The link has to be an apartment link, with no house, no condos, and no townhomes. 

Example link: 

&check; https://www.apartments.com/apartments/houston-tx/

&cross; https://www.apartments.com/apartments-houses-condos/los-angeles-ca/

&cross; https://www.apartments.com/condos/new-york-ny/

(You'll need to put the full link of the page)

Right now the website only works for apartments.com, but I plan on adding other apartment listing websites to be available. I'm also planning to add houses, condos, and townhomes available also.
